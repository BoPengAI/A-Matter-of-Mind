I use this space to organize and present my thoughts on intelligence and consciousness. My motivations for setting up this page are two fold:
1. Writing it down forces a little more clarity.
2. I hope it could lead to connections and discussions with others interested in these topics. 

It's an exciting time to be alive to witness the current phase of rapid progress, exploration, and discovery in AI and neuroscience. I'm giddy with the child-like bated breath that a new world is unfolding before my eyes.

My PhD is in non-linear dynamics, chemical oscillations and chaos. My postdoc is in non-equilibrium thermodynamics. My job is a quant. Please excuse my (probably often) transgressions in math.
