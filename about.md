I use this space to organize and present my thoughts on intelligence and consciousness. My motivations for setting up this page are two fold:
1. Writing it down forces a little more clarity.
2. I hope it could lead to connections and discussions with others interested in these topics. 

It's an exciting time to be alive to witness the current phase of rapid progress, exploration, and discovery in AI and cognitive. I'm giddy with the child-like bated breath that a new world is unfolding before my eyes.

My PhD is in non-linear dynamics, chemical oscillations and chaos. My postdoc is in non-equilibrium thermodynamics. My job is a quant, which is for people who's good at neither math nor coding...speaking personally. Please excuse my (probably often) transgressions in math, which I will minimize by avoiding math as long as I can get away with it.

Many thanks to [Jonathan Shore](https://tr8dr.github.io/) for allowing me to plagiarize his design, and many interesting discussions.
